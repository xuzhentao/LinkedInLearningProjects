1. When we submit form, we need to make it a "POST" request instead of the default "GET" request.
    - In the HTML <form>, please add 'method="post"'
    - In the app.py's route, please explicitly add "POST" request method, otherwise Flask will only take "GET" request for safety reason. i.e. @app.route("/your-url", methods=["GET", "POST"])
